Grasshopper Analysis Scripts


This repository is a collection of Grasshopper scripts developed for a wide range of design and architectural analysis tasks. Whether you're a student, architect, or designer, you'll find various tools here to integrate data-driven insights into your Rhino workflows.

The scripts range from environmental analysis to geometric optimization, each designed to be a flexible and powerful tool for your projects.

This collection is diverse and may include analyses such as:

    Environmental Analysis: Scripts for solar radiation studies, sun path diagrams, shadow analysis, and wind flow simulations.

    Geometric Optimization: Tools utilizing genetic algorithms (like Galapagos) to solve complex design problems, such as pathfinding, structural form-finding, or material efficiency.

    Data Visualization: Scripts that help translate complex datasets into clear and compelling visual graphics within the Rhino environment.

    Structural & Form-Finding: Exploratory scripts for analyzing and generating structurally efficient forms.

    And more! The repository is actively updated with new and experimental analyses.

How to Use

    Prerequisites: You will need Rhinoceros 3D and Grasshopper installed.

    Plugins: Some scripts may require specific Grasshopper plugins (e.g., Ladybug, Kangaroo, Weaverbird). Please check the notes within each .gh file or any accompanying README files for specific dependencies.

    Download: You can clone this repository or download the individual Grasshopper (.gh) files you need.

    Open & Use: Open the files in Grasshopper and connect your own geometry to the designated inputs. Most scripts are commented to guide you through the process.
