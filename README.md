# Gh_Essentials

A collection of Grasshopper files for my skill development, testing, and learning.
This repository contains various Grasshopper definitions that explore different concepts and techniques in computational design.

---

## Contents

* **Find Parallel Vectors.gh**: A Grasshopper definition to find and group parallel vectors from a given list of vectors.
* **Group Similar Values into a Branch.gh**: A script that takes a list of values and groups similar values into separate data branches.
* **Point Attractor_c#.gh**: A C# script implementing a point attractor logic to manipulate geometry based on proximity to a point.
* **sinCos_Curve.gh**: A definition that generates a parametric curve using sine and cosine functions.

## How to Use

1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Open the `.gh` files in Grasshopper.
3.  Connect your geometry or data to the input components.
4.  Experiment with the parameters and components to understand how each definition works.
